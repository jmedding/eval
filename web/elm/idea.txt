If we want to make user defined evaluators, ie a service that can be
configured by a user, the problem will be to set up some of the elm code
that needs to extract data from the records.

For example, the current  Excluder models include a function that is used

to get the value of the specific product parameter

	( "Diameter", \product -> product.diameter)

since there seems to be no way in Elm to fetch the paramer value based on
a String (in our case, the label)

One way to solve this would be to use Phoenix to generate an Elm module that
return the proper function based on the label String

	Module ProductGetter exposing (...) 

	Import Components.Product as Product exposing ( Model )

	getMeasureValForProduct : Model -> String -> Float
	getMeasureValForProduct model label =
		case label of
			"Reliability" -> model.reliability
			"Price"	-> model.price


	It might be easier to just append this the Product module.

	Filters (Bool values) could be another function
