/* This file is for your main application css. */

// Inverted triangle for the import order, but modified a little bit for our

// Here's what Inverted Triangle CSS is:
// - https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/

// == SETTINGS ==
@import "settings.colors";
@import "settings.metrics";
@import "settings.global";

// == TOOLS ==
@import "tools.mixins";

// == ELEMENTS ==
// NOTE: This will hold element-specific styles in one file for// now, but I
// expect it to expand later
@import "elements";

// == PAGES ==
// @import "./pages/*";

// == LAYOUTS ==
// @import "./layouts/*";

// == COMPONENTS ==
// @import "./components/*";
// NOTE: We can't use "globbing" in sass with sass-brunch until the next release
// easily, so I'll list each component for now. I will ultimately switch to
// webpack so I didn't want to spend time fixing this for brunch.
@import "components/eval-chart";
@import "components/measure";
